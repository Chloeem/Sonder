# Sonder
> *We help refugee mothers access all the help they need.*

**Sonder is a web app designed to provide all the necessities to refugee mothers, to reopen the door back to experiencing the joys of motherhood and childhood, without any limitations.**

Sonder is the two-week project of six Makers Academy students from the January 2022 cohort: ChloÃ«, Jaroslaw, Eddie, Chris, Dash and Francesco. We all share the same passion of wanting to build something that does good.

Some of us are personally impacted by the current international events, and all of us are deeply invested in the refugee crisis.

While there are many charities helping refugees, we couldn't find a specific platform dedicated to helping refugee mothers and pregnant women.

The term Sonder describes the sudden realisation that everyone has a story, and that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as everyone else. We are all living connected stories. These values of communion and empathy are at the core of Sonder.

## What you can do with Sonder

* On Sonder, refugee mothers can log into their personal area, and submit a request of help by picking items from different categories.

*  The request is then available on the platform.

* Donors and volunteers can honour a request, and by doing so the mother in need is notified via email.

* The website is fully translated in seven languages, including Ukrainian, to make it as accessible as possible. It also uses icons and images where possible, for the same reason.
